description: "Collaboration with a friend that is a beer enthusiast also. Cream ale is one of his favorite styles and I didn't know much about them until he told me he wanted to make one. When I think cream ale, I think a lot of body and well...creamy. The style really isn't that at all. We are looking for a dry, somewhat strong cream ale. We are going to use a German yeast to get a little more character and less of a lager bite. Almost a 30% corn bill and we ended up having to substitute distillers malt and 2 row for 6 row, which I have never used. The goal is a drinkable, clear and bright cream ale without a lot of bite but a little more body than a lower ABV cream ale."
