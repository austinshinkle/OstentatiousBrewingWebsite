description: "Doppelbock will be the first lager I have ever made. It is one of my favorite styles and one that isn't made too much outside Germany. At least I haven't seen too many craft breweries in the US make the style. As often with my recipes, this borrows heavily from Craft Beer and Brewing. That magazine hasn't let me down yet. The goal is to make a rich, but clean beer drinkable on a winter night, given that it will be ready just a few weeks before Christmas."
