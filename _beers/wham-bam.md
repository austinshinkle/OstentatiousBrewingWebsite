description: "Since I have plenty of beer right now, I thought I would make a barleywine since it will take time to mature in the bottles. I have never tried this style but now that I know about yeast starters I think it will be worth a shot. I will try to make a smaller batch to see if I can get the gravity up. This recipe is based on a clone of Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot Barleywine from the AHA."
