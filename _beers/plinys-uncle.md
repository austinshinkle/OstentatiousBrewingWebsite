description: "This beer is my first attempt at brewing an all grain batch using my new Rubbermaid 10 gallon cooler mash tun. I am using a clone recipe of Pliny the Elder released to the American Homebrewer's Association by Russian River Brewing in Santa Rosa, CA as a basis. I am not using the recipe one for one largely because of the crazy hop bill and the fact that I have low expectations for my first all grain batch."
