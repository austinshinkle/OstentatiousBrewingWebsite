      description:
          "The beer came out a little heavy, most likely due to too much unfermentable sugar. I believe this is due to
          the mash temperature. If you make this again, mash at a lower temperature to get a drier finish. Also, maybe
          try a hop with a little more fruity character that can be accentuated by the yeast."
