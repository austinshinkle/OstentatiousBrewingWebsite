description: "As a fan of the Belgian style this will be a good beer to continue brewing. I am going to go back to all grain brewing so that my wife can use the spent grain for bread. :) I chose a Belgian because I really enjoy Belgian beers and this is an all grain version of the Belgian IPA I made before using extract. Hopefully, it will turn out like the last one!"
