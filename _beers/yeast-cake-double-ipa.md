description: "A beer to use up existing ingredients that I had and didn't want to waste. I saw a video that said you can pitch a new beer on top of a previous yeast cake and I thought I had to try it! This will use the yeast cake of Simcoe SMaSH which is essentially a very large starter of WLP001 California Ale yeast. It will further let me experiment with fermenting a big beer and also test out what hops I like in beers. I tend to like the more crisp beers so I went with classic Pilsner type Noble hops"
