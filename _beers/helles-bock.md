description: "This beer style is something that I have wanted to try as well as I also want to make another doppelbock so I can make a new beer style and create a large yeast starter for another doppelbock. Win win! This beer will be crisp and light in color, with a medium ABV. It will be similar to a Maibock which will be perfect since it will probably be May before I end up completing it."
