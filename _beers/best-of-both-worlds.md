description: "This double IPA will be an experiment to overdo it. Usually, my IPA designs seem like what I want but they end up falling short. Maybe this is because I don't get the IBU I expect from them or the yeast performance isn't up to par or maybe something entirely different. This recipe is more of everything: malt, a different yeast and a ton of hops from the US and Southern Hemisphere...hopefully it truly will be the best of both worlds."
