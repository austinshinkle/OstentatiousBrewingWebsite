description: "I haven't brewed and IPA in a while so this is my attempt to get back into it. I like clean NW IPAs as opposed to the new Hazy NE style so the goal if this IPA is a crisp and strong IPA. I calculated new brewhouse efficiency and boil off numbers from my last beers so this will be a good chance to validate those calculations."
