description: "This will be a remix of the Doppelbock that I made right before Christmas 2020. I am going to pitch this on top of the yeast cake from Helles Bock. I have tweaked the recipe slightly. The ingredients are all the same as the original but I have increased everything: more IBU, more ABV and more of the rich malts. The first version was so good I don't want to tweak things too much."
