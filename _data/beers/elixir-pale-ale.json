    "description": "At the request of my wife, this is a lighter beer for the summer months with modest IBUs. The beer should have a light body that is easy drinking for summer. The Nugget hops should allow for a solid base hop profile of slightly woodsy and mild and the Elixir hops should bring a orange fruitiness that is perfect for sipping on a summer day!",
