    "description": "IPA inspired by our vacation to Yakima, Washington. All hops used are from Yakima Valley Hops. The inspiration for the beer is the fruit that grows in the Yakima Valley. The beer will be light bodied with a mild bitter start and a fruity finish to show off the hops. This beer uses six different hops with half mid-boil and the other half late in the boil to show off their flavors! Cheers!",
