description: "A full body Russian Imperial Stout. The goal of this beer is to experiment making a high gravity beer with a FG that finishes around 1.020 and doesn't leave a sweet taste in your mouth. I have not had good results brewing high ABV beers in the past and I believe that this is due to a lack of yeast. This beer will let me test that theory so I will use two packages of yeast. This is the first beer brewed with my new Blichmann Hellfire burner and Blichmann 10 gallon G2 Boilermaker kettle."
