description:
    "At the request of my wife, this is a lighter beer for the summer months with modest IBUs. The beer should have a
    light body that is easy drinking for summer. The Nugget hops should allow for a solid base hop profile of slightly
    woodsy and mild and the Elixir hops should bring a orange fruitiness that is perfect for sipping on a summer day!"
