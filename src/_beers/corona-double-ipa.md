description: "Needing something to do to prevent cabin fever from being stuck in the house, I decided to make a homebrew. This is inspired by Ballast Point Brewing, who publish recipes for homebrewers which I think is great. It shows they really love brewing! . I also build a fermentation chamber to ferment at a consistent temperature and be able to cold crash, so this is the first attempt with my new equipment."
