description: "As I look to expand my operation, I will be looking to do more lagers. I have shied away from them before since I didn't want to tie up my equipment for a month or two at a time. I do enjoy lagers and it would be good to have some light and crisp homebrew for consumption. I am looking to get another fermenter and another fermentation chamber to allow two beers to be fermenting at once. I also had an email conversation with some at my water district that gave me the analysis of the water and how to correct it. This beer will be brewed with a water adjustment instead of buying chloromine free water from the store."
