            <h2>BREW SETUP</h2>
            <p>
                OSTENTATIOUS BREWING IS A 0.12 BBL BREWERY (ALSO KNOWN AS 5 GAL). OUR BEER IS NOT SOLD IN STORES, MOSTLY
                BECAUSE MY FRIENDS AND I DRINK IT ALL, BUT ALSO BECAUSE SELLING BEER IN OREGON (I'M IN PORTLAND) MEANS
                YOU NEED TO REGISTER AS A BREWERY. IT IS TOO BAD, BECAUSE I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO SELL BEER AT FARMER'S
                MARKETS TO GET FEEDBACK.
                5 GAL IS ALSO PERFECT SINCE YOU CAN MANUALLY MOVE THE BEER AROUND. IF LARGER BATCHES ARE MADE, YOU NEED
                TO PUMP WORT AND FLUID AROUND. ALSO, IF YOU MAKE SMALLER BATCHES, YOU CAN DRINK A BATCH AND MOVE ON TO
                TRYING NEW THINGS, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR REFINING THE CRAFT. SEE THE BREWING SETUP PAGE FOR ADDITIONAL
                TIPS AND TRICKS.
