        <p>A look into the equipment and processes that power Ostentatious Brewing. From precision temperature control
            to manual wort management, here's how we craft our beer.</p>

                <h3>Boil Kettle</h3>
                <p>A Blichmann 10-gallon G2 Boilermaker kettle paired with a Blichmann Hellfire burner. This setup
                    provides rapid heating and precise boil control, essential for consistent hop extraction.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Mash Tun</h3>
                <p>A modified 10-gallon Rubbermaid cooler serves as our mash tun. Its excellent insulation maintains
                    temperatures within 1°F over a 60-minute mash, critical for proper enzymatic conversion. A
                    non-heated mash tun doesn't allow you to heat the wort for more complex mashes, but a single
                    infusion has always done the trick.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Fermentation Vessels</h3>
                <p>We utilize Spiedel 30L plastic fermenters. They are food grade, lightweight, and durable. A 30L
                    fermentation vessel is ideal for a 5 gallon batch as there is plenty of room for the krausen to rise
                    and settle.</p>

                <h3>Yeast Starters & Stir Plate</h3>
                <p>Healthy yeast is the secret to great beer. We use a Maelstrom stir plate and Erlenmeyer flasks to
                    grow high cell counts, ensuring vigorous fermentations even for high-gravity stouts and IPAs.</p>

                    Pitching Rates Matter
                </h4>
                <p>High ABV beers often struggle if you don't pitch enough yeast, but every beer benefits from a healthy
                    pitch of yeast. I use starters for every beer to ensure maximum fermentation. Pitching on a previous
                    yeast cake is a pro move for extreme gravity beers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-item">

                    Temperature Control
                </h4>
                <p>Fermentation temperature is the biggest difference between good beer and great beer. Keeping a stable
                    temperature avoids off-flavors (fusels, esters) that can ruin a clean lager or pale ale.</p>

                    Oxygenation
                </h4>
                <p>Aerating with pure oxygen for 60 seconds before pitching yeast leads to a much healthier lag phase.
                    This is especially important when using starters, as the yeast needs oxygen to build strong cell
                    walls. Use a diffuser connected to an oxygen torch canister for to give the yeast a healthy infusion
                    of oxygen.</p>

                    Yeast Cakes
                </h4>
                <p>Pitching a new, compatible beer on a yeast cake from a previous batch is a great way save money, and
                    a perfect way to brew a high gravity beer. Pitch a Doppelbock onto the yeast cake of a Maibock or
                    Helles Bock to maximize cost and brewing efficiency.</p>

                    Water
                </h4>
                <p>Water is one of the most important ingredients in brewing. Ask your local water district for an
                    analysis of your water profile and determine how to adjust it to a basic profile. To counteract
                    chlorine and choride, one 5 cent Campden Tablet elevated my brews to a whole new level. At that
                    point, the taste went from home brewed to brewery quality.</p>
