    "description": "The plan was to make an IPA to showcase the homegrown Willamette hops from 2021 but they didn't seem like they kept well. This beer was a collaboration with a friend and we made a game time decision to stick with a SMaSH but use Glacier hops I had. Glacier hops are featured in this beer with Pale High Color Malt from Great Western Malting.",
